# SQL Assignment Week 1 Answers

1. **State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)**
   - **Hardware**: Physical devices like computers, storage devices, and network devices.
   - **Software**: The DBMS software itself, along with the operating system and application programs.
   - **Data**: The actual data stored in the database.
   - **Procedures**: Instructions and rules for designing and running the database.
   - **Database Access Language**: Language used to access and manipulate the database (e.g., SQL).

2. **What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.**
   - A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables with rows and columns. Each table represents a different entity, and relationships between tables are established through keys.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.

3. **State and Explain three classifications of SQL?**
   - **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Used to define and manage database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
   - **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Used to manipulate data within the database (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
   - **DCL (Data Control Language)**: Used to control access to data within the database (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

4. **What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?**
   - **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a record in a table. It must contain unique values and cannot be NULL.
   - **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.

5. **What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?**
   - An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a graphical representation of entities and their relationships to each other within a database. It is used to model the logical structure of the database.

6. **What are the advantages of relational databases?**
   - Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
   - Flexibility: Easy to add, update, and delete data.
   - Scalability: Can handle large amounts of data.
   - Security: Provides robust security features to protect data.

7. **State four types of data type used to store data in tables?**
   - **INT**: Integer data type.
   - **VARCHAR**: Variable-length character data type.
   - **DATE**: Date data type.
   - **BOOLEAN**: Boolean data type (true/false).

8. **What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?**
   - A DBMS is used to store, retrieve, and manage data in databases. It provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the data, ensures data integrity, and enforces security measures.
